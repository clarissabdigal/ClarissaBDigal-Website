        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I am currently a First-Year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. Where I am majoring in Biochemistry under the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, with Medical Sciences Emphasis. I decided to pursue Biochemistry because it is one of the more rigorous majors in CNAS, which would be valuable for veterinarian school after I graduate with my B.S. Although I do not plan on joining any of UCR's organizations and or clubs, I plan to join their Veterinarian Club during my Second Year where I hope I am more adjusted to college. The reason why I decided to attend the University of California, Riverside is simply because I planned on commuting to school and conveniently was a UC that would only be a 20-minute commute.      <br>

        My childhood consisted of being born in Northern California, more specifically Walnut Creek where there are trees and lots of greenery unlike here in Southern California. However, due to my parents splitting up my mom decided to move down to the Inland Empire where she found a Registered Nurse position in the Behavioral Health Department. Due to the sudden move, I was enrolled in pre-school at 5-years-old instead of 4-years-old as most kids are. I do not recall much of my elementary growth or experiences, but I do know that I excelled in all of my classes and was part of the G.A.T.E. program. G.A.T.E., which stood for Gifted and Talented Education, this was a program that was locally funded to provide students who exceeded standards and were given opportunities. This program enabled me to become enrolled in all Honors classes in Middle School, where I excelled in many classes such as Biology, Physics, and Algebra 1. During Middle School, I became heavily involved in the school's Yearbook Club where I became President in my 8th grade. This enabled me to gain some leadership, communication, and editing skills which are still valuable to me today.   <br><br>

       
        Once I became a freshman in High School, I was immediately overwhelmed by all of the expectations that High School brings to a teenager. I did not take any Advanced Placement classes during my freshman year because my school did not allow any freshman to take such rigorous courses in their first year of high school. My first Advanced Placement course was World History, this was the only A.P. course I took during my sophomore year. Due to contrary belief, junior year of high school is the most important year of any student who plans on attending university after high school. Thus, I took 3 Advanced Placement courses which were Calculus AB, Biology, and English Language and Composition. I also was part of a few school clubs and organizations including Key Club, M.E.S.A. (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement), and Biological Sciences. My senior year is where I decided to give myself a break to be able to enjoy my last year in High School, I took 2 A.P. courses which were Statistics and Chemistry. This was the year where I found my passion to become a veterinarian, I have a female husky who I love as my own daughter and I believe that animals deserve better treatment in society. It is one of my life goals to own or fund an organization that helps animals in need, and owners who are not able to financially treat their pets.   </p>
